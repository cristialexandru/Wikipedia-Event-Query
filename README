 - Wikipedia-Event-Query -
 A collection of scripts in python that uses the Wikipedia API,
 MongoDB and Flask to store data about events from wikipedia
 pages (all days of the year) updated every two hours and
 allows the user to query through this results in order to get
 the events from a specific day in a specific year (in json
 format).

-> initialize_db.py
Uses the wikipedia api to get the specific section from a page
representing a date and an event category (Event, Birth, Death,
Holidays and observances) and store them in a MongoDB server
which runs on a specific IP and port (by default localhost).

This script uses threads (no more than 8 at a time by default) to
parse every page (from 1st 0f January to the 31st of December) and
store them in a MongoDB server. The server is structured as follows:
4 databases: 'evs', 'brts', 'dths', 'holo' representing the type
of events and every database has a collection for each day. Each
collection contains documents in the following format:

					{'year' : year,
					'day : day,
					'category' : category,
					'desc' : title}

The script launches its threads every two hours and updates the
database which is erased every time at the beginning. (it uses
"schedule" to do this, for more info: https://github.com/dbader/schedule)

-> server.py
It uses the Flask framework to process requests for the database:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/?year=2005&day=March_13&category=births

and returns the query in JSON format (as specified):

{"results":   [{"title":   "example",   "year":   2005,
"day": "March_13", "category": "births"}, {"title": ... }]}
